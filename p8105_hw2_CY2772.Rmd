# Problem 1
## Part1: Data Cleaning:

* Retain variables: line, station, name, station latitude, longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA compliance.

* Convert entry to logical: The entry column has YES or NO values, so you'll need to convert it into a logical TRUE/FALSE format. You can use functions like ifelse() or case_when() to accomplish t

```{r}
# Read and clean the data
nyc_subway_data = read_csv("hw2_prob1_dataset.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1:route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = case_when(
    entry == "YES" ~ TRUE,
    entry == "NO"  ~ FALSE
  )) # Convert entry to logical TRUE/FALSE

# View the cleaned data
nyc_subway_data

```
